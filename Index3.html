            Hi everyone, my name is Jessie Bologna and I am here developing my very first website for CS50. I am new to computer science, and CS50 is truly the perfect course to start with. So far I have learned a great deal of useful information that I hope to put to good use in my future studies. I will be starting a Masters degree in bioinformatics soon, and am diligently working towards learning as much computer and data science as I can to ready myself. So far I really love computer science, it is great fun, and I cant wait to learn more!
